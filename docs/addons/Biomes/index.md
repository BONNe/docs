## How to use

1. Place the addon jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin
2. Restart the server
3. The addon will create a data folder and inside the folder will be a *config.yml* and an example *biomes.yml*
4. Edit the config.yml and *biomes.yml* files how you want. The *biomes.yml* is for importing only.
5. Restart the server

## Config.yml

After addon is successful installed, it will create config.yml file. Every option in this file comes with comments about them. Please check file for more information.
Most of options are also editable admin via commands.

## Biomes.yml

This file contains all necessary information about default biomes. 
If you change values in biomes.yml, then to apply them, you must run **/bsb biomes import** or **/acid biomes import**.

If you want to force an overwrite of biomes via an import, add the **overwrite** option to the end of the import command.
Note that you must import biomes into both BSkyBlock and AcidIsland separately.

## Commands

!!! tip
    `[user_command]` and `[admin_command]` are prefixes that differs depending on the gamemode you are running. Gamemodes config section contains option to modify these values.
    F.e. in BSkyBlock default `[user_command]` is `island` and default `[admin_command]` is `bsbadmin`. 

### User commands

* `/[user_command] biomes`: This method opens GUI that allows to change biome on User island.
* `/[user_command] biomes help`: Show help for all the commands
* `/[user_command] biomes info <biome>`: This command returns information about given biome, like cost and necessary level.
* `/[user_command] biomes set <biome> [<type>] [<size>]`: This command allows to change biome on island without opening GUI. If prarameters < type> and < size> are not provided, command uses default values from addon config.

!!! info
        - `<biome>` may not be equal Minecraft biome name. It is defined by admin.
        - `<type>` is one of 3 biome chaning types. It offers to change biome on whole island (`ISLAND`), in current chunk(-s) (`CHUNK`) or by distance around player (`RANGE`).

* `/[admin_command] biomes set <player> <biome> [<type>] [<size>]`: This command works the same as user biome set command, but it is necessary to provide also player, which island biome will be updated.

## Permissions

!!! tip
    `[gamemode]` is a prefix that differs depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The prefix is the lowercased name of the gamemode, i.e. if you are using BSkyBlock, the prefix is `bskyblock`.
    Similarly, if you are using AcidIsland, the prefix is `acidisland`.
