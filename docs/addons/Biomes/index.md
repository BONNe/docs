# Biomes

**Biomes** lets your players **change the biome** on their island.

Created and maintained by [BONNe](https://github.com/BONNe).

{{ addon_description("Biomes", beta=True) }}

## Installation

1. Put the addon jar in the `plugins/BentoBox/addons` folder.
2. Start and stop the server to let Biomes generate its configuration files.
3. Edit the [`config.yml`](#configyml) and [`biomes.yml`](#biomesyml) files (you can find them in the `plugins/BentoBox/addons/Biomes` folder).
4. Restart the server.
5. Import the biomes into the gamemode.

## Configuration

### config.yml

After addon is successful installed, it will create config.yml file. Every option in this file comes with comments about them. Please check file for more information.
Most options are also editable admin via commands.

### biomes.yml

!!! warning
    Unlike usual configuration files, the changes you make to the `biomes.yml` file are not automatically taken into account when starting the server.  
    You must import manually the changes you made and eventually override them if you already imported a previous configuration.

This file contains all necessary information about default biomes.
If you change values in biomes.yml, then to apply them, you must run **/[admin_command] biomes import**.

If you want to force an overwrite of biomes via an import, add the **overwrite** option to the end of the import command.
Note that you must import biomes into both BSkyBlock and AcidIsland separately.

## Commands

!!! tip
    `[player_command]` and `[admin_command]` are commands that differ depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The Gamemodes' `config.yml` file contains options that allows you to modify these values.
    As an example, on BSkyBlock, the default `[player_command]` is `island`, and the default `[admin_command]` is `bsbadmin`.

=== "Player commands"
    - `/[player_command] biomes`: This method opens GUI that allows to change biome on User island.
    - `/[player_command] biomes help`: Show help for all the commands
    - `/[player_command] biomes info <biome>`: This command returns information about given biome, like cost and necessary level.
    - `/[player_command] biomes set <biome> [<type>] [<size>]`: This command allows to change biome on island without opening GUI. If prarameters < type> and < size> are not provided, command uses default values from addon config.

    !!! info
        - `<biome>` may not be the actual Minecraft biome name. It is defined by the admin.
        - `<type>` is one of the three biome change types. It offers to change biome on whole island (`ISLAND`), in current chunk(s) (`CHUNK`) or by distance around player (`RANGE`).
        - Currently, the biome is changed on the entire y axis. This behaviour might change in the future as Minecraft 1.16 brings support for 3D biomes.

=== "Admin commands"
    - `/[admin_command] biomes`: opens the Admin Biomes GUI.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes help`: displays the help for all the Biomes-related admin commands.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes import [overwrite]`: imports biomes from the `biomes.yml` configuration file.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes add <biome>`: adds a new biome that can be edited via GUI or `biomes edit` command. Biome will not be deployed. To do it, you should enable it in GUI or via `biomes edit <biome> deployed true` command.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes set <player> <biome> [<type>] [<size>]`: works the same as user biome set command, but it is necessary to provide also player, which island biome will be updated.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes edit <biome> <property> <new_value>`: edits provided biome property to new value.
    - `/[admin_command] biomes settings <property> <new_value>`: edits current addon settings via command.

## Permissions

!!! tip
    `[gamemode]` is a prefix that differs depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The prefix is the lowercased name of the gamemode, i.e. if you are using BSkyBlock, the prefix is `bskyblock`.
    Similarly, if you are using AcidIsland, the prefix is `acidisland`.
