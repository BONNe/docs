## Commands

There are no commands.

## What it does
This addon will give players a separate inventory, health, food level and experience for each gamemode installed and its corresponding worlds. It will allow players to play each gamemode independently of another by forbidding sharing of resources between worlds.

## An example
**BSkyBlock**'s Inventory, Health, Food level and Experience are shared only between its corresponding worlds:
- BSkyBlock_world
- BSkyBlock_world_nether
- BSkyBlock_world_the_end

**AcidIsland**'s Inventory, Health, Food level and Experience are shared only between its corresponding worlds:
- AcidIsland_world
- AcidIsland_world_nether
- AcidIsland_world_the_end

**Please note:**
- It is not limited to just BentoBox worlds. It applies to all worlds on the server (right now).
