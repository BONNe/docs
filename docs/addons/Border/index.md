## Commands

!!! tip
    `[player_command]` is a command that differs depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The Gamemodes' `config.yml` file contains options that allows you to modify this value.
    As an example, on BSkyBlock, the default `[player_command]` is `island`.

- `/[player_command] border`: toggles whether the border is shown or not.

## Permissions

!!! tip
    `[gamemode]` is a prefix that differs depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The prefix is the lowercased name of the gamemode, i.e. if you are using BSkyBlock, the prefix is `bskyblock`.
    Similarly, if you are using AcidIsland, the prefix is `acidisland`.

- `[gamemode].border.toggle` (default: *unknown*): enables/disables the use of the command.
