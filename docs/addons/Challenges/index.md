## Installation

1. Place the addon jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin
2. Restart the server
3. Run the admin challenges command, e.g., `/bsbadmin challenges` to configure the addon

## Configuration

By default, the challenges addon comes without any challenge or levels. On first runtime only the Admin GUI will be accessible.
Admins can create their own challenges or load a set of default challenges. Default challenges contains 5 levels and 57 challenges.
There also exist a Web Library, where admins can download public challenges. It is accessible via the Admin GUI by clicking on the Web icon.

## Commands

!!! tip
    `[player_command]` and `[admin_command]` are commands that differ depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The Gamemodes' `config.yml` file contains options that allows you to modify these values.
    As an example, on BSkyBlock, the default `[player_command]` is `island`, and the default `[admin_command]` is `bsbadmin`.

=== "Player commands"
    - `/challenges`: Access Player Challenges GUI. Contains either Challenges in current world or list of worlds where are Challenges enabled. This must be enabled in configuration.
    - `/[player_command] challenges [challenge] [number]`: Access BSkyBlock Player Challenges GUI. If challenge name is provided, than this method will complete that challenge once. If number is provided, than it will complete challenge from 0-number times.

=== "Admin commands"
    - `/challengesadmin`: Access Admin Challenges GUI. Contains list of worlds where Challenges are enabled. This must be enabled in configuration.
    - `/[admin_command] challenges`: Access BSkyBlock Admin Challenges GUI
    - `/[admin_command] challenges reload [hard]`: Ability to reload Challengs addon configuration. This method clears also cache data. Parameter hard allows to reset database connection.
    - `/[admin_command] challenges import [overwrite]`: Ability to import ASkyBlock challenges. Requires challenges.yml file in ./plugins/BentoBox/addons/Challenges/ folder. Parameter overwrite allows to overwrite existing challenges.
    - `/[admin_command] challenges defaults import`: Ability to import Default challenges. This method will not work, if in current world already exist challenges or levels.
    - `/[admin_command] challenges defaults generate`: Ability to export existing challenges. This method will generate defaults.json file in ./plugins/BentoBox/addons/Challenges/ folder.


## Permissions

!!! tip
    `[gamemode]` is a prefix that differs depending on the gamemode you are running.
    The prefix is the lowercased name of the gamemode, i.e. if you are using BSkyBlock, the prefix is `bskyblock`.
    Similarly, if you are using AcidIsland, the prefix is `acidisland`.
