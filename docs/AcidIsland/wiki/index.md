# Introduction
AcidIsland add-on for BentoBox, so to run AcidIsland, you must have BentoBox installed. It is not a Bukkit plugin and trying to use it as one will not work.


## The Story
You're on an island, in a sea of acid! If you like Skyblock, try AcidIsland for a new challenge!

This is a variation of SkyBlock. Instead of falling, you must contend with acid water when expanding your island and players can boat to each other's islands.

## Installation

0. Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.
1. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin.
2. Restart the server.
3. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml.
4. Stop the server.
5. Edit the config.yml how you want.
6. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them.
7. Restart the server.
