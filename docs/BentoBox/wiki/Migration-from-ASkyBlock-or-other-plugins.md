## Introduction

As of BentoBox's 1.5.0 release, we have developed a converter that allows you to keep your data and worlds from ASkyBlock in order to use them on BSkyBlock. More plugins *might* be supported in the future.

This converter is being developed and maintained independently from BentoBox's codebase and detailed, up-to-date and reliable documentation is to be found on its [dedicated repository](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/Converter).

**This process, although being able to handle a number of key conversion points (player files, islands, ...), is not to be deemed as a one-size-fits-all solution. Precautions have to be taken when performing a conversion : taking backups and applying instructions to the letter are no options.**

## Available converters

We have developed a converter for ASkyBlock to BSkyBlock. It is easy to use and handles a number of key conversion points:

1. Player files
2. Teams
3. Island files
4. Warp signs
5. General config settings for the world

As Askybock only supported up to server version 1.12.2, the server itself and the associated world files also need to be updated. This is handled by running the new server jar with the â€”forceUpgrade flag.
