## How do I install BentoBox, BSkyBlock and all those other addon things?

We have set up various ways to allow you to easily install BentoBox and its addons.
You can check out [this tutorial](BentoBox/Install-Bentobox.md) to learn about all of them.
**Welcome in our community!**

# Configuration

## How do I make my own custom islands?

You are referring to our **in-house schematic format** we call **_Blueprints_**.
The [Blueprints page](BentoBox/Blueprints.md) provides all the relevant information to get you started with the Blueprints, as well as a few hints and tricks you can use to further customize them.
You can also have a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/4gvaG89uxAs) which, although outdated, might help you create your first Blueprint within minutes.

## What version of MySQL is required? Or any database?

Minimum required versions:

* MySQL versions 5.7 or later
* MariaDB versions 10.2.3 or later
* MongoDB versions 3.6 or later
* SQLite versions 3.28 or later

# Issues

## Superflat chunks are generating in my worlds

*Relevant issues:*

If you start seeing superflat chunks being generated in your world, then it is because the world generator is not working for the world anymore.
There are a few reasons why this may be the case. They are ordered according to their likeliness.

**We strongly recommend you to revert to backups made prior to this situation**.
Although we are providing additional instructions to help recover from such an event in case you do not have backups available, we **do not guarantee their effectiveness**.
Moreover, these solutions are **designed to address the problem as much as possible, however, ignoring the impact on performance or player islands**.
Use them knowingly.

In any case, **stop your server immediately to prevent further damage from being done to your worlds**. 

### Causes

#### BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is no longer running

##### Why?

BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is not enabled on the server.
This can occur if you updated BentoBox or the Gamemode addon to a version which is not compatible with your server or which is incompatible with one of your plugins.

##### Solutions

Investigate as to why BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is no longer enabled.
Read the logs to find errors at startup.
Try booting your server up while adding a single plugin at a time to find out which plugin is causing the issue.

#### There is no generator set for this world in the `bukkit.yml` file

##### Why?

This is often the situation.
While setting the default world of your server to be the Gamemode addon's world, you forgot to specify the right generator for said world in the `bukkit.yml` file.

##### Solutions

Make sure you followed each step of [this tutorial](BentoBox/wiki/Set-a-BentoBox-world-as-the-server-default-world) thoroughly.

#### The `use-own-generator` option from the Gamemode's config is set to `true`

##### Why?

This is a common mistake.

Users tend to misunderstand this option as allowing them to activate a "magic" cobblestone generator (but [it's an addon](addons/MagicCobblestoneGenerator/index.md)!).
This is indeed not what this option is designed for, and this is clearly explained in the comments surrounding this option in the config file:

```yaml
# Use your own world generator for this world.
# In this case, the plugin will not generate anything.
# If used, you must specify the world name and generator in the bukkit.yml file.
# See https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Bukkit.yml#.2AOPTIONAL.2A_worlds
use-own-generator: false
```

Ultimately, this can also happen if you forgot the specify the world name and generator in the `bukkit.yml` file.

##### Solutions

If you do not plan to use an external plugin to generate the world, then you should set this option back to `false`.

On the contrary, you should make sure you have specified the world name and the corresponding plugin name as its generator in the `bukkit.yml` file.

#### Another plugin is trying to control the generator of this world

##### Why?

Although very rare, this can still happen.

Some plugins, especially world management ones (e.g. Multiverse), tend to provide settings that could override the generator of our worlds.

##### Solutions

Review all of your plugins to find out which one is the most likely to cause the issue.
World management plugins or custom-coded ones that are interacting with worlds are to be investigated first.
Either report the issue to their developers or fix the configuration files that are involved.  

#### There is a bug in BentoBox or in the Gamemode addon

##### Why?

*Woopsie!*

Nowadays, this is extremely rare.
But it might still happen for some reasons.

##### Solutions

Make sure this is actually a BentoBox-related bug: remove all the plugins from your server one by one until only BentoBox is left.

If the issue is no longer occurring, this means another plugin is causing it.
In that case, please refer yourself to [this section]().

If the issue still occurs, this means this is a BentoBox bug.
Please [report it on our bug tracker](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox/issues).

### How to clean the superflat chunks afterwards?

If you have backups, use them to revert your server's worlds and BentoBox databases to their previous states.

If you do not have backups, <WIP>.

## My server lags when a new island is created!
The paste speed may be too much for your machine. Try lowering it. Look in the BentoBox config.yml for this setting:
```yaml
# Number of blocks to paste per tick when pasting blueprints.
# Smaller values will help reduce noticeable lag but will make pasting take slightly longer.
# On the contrary, greater values will make pasting take less time, but this benefit is quickly severely impacted by the
# resulting amount of chunks that must be loaded to fulfill the process, which often causes the server to hang out.
paste-speed: 64
```
And change it to 8 or something.

# API

## How do I start writing addons for BentoBox? Is there an API?

Yes, there is definitely an API.
Writing addons is very similar to writing plugins except there is a lot more API available for things like teams, protections, commands, panels and pasting.
