<h3>PlaceHolders</h3>

**SkyGrid** does not have specific placeholders. It integrates into BentoBox plugin and in all its addon, that implements placeholders, like Level and Likes. 

To use these placeholders, you just need to replace `[gamemode]` with `skygrid` and placeholder will work.

f.e.: `%skygrid_world_friendly_name%`

You can find a list of available placeholders here: [BentoBox Wiki Placeholders](https://github.com/BentoBoxWorld/BentoBox/wiki/Placeholders#default-placeholders-for-gamemode-addons).
