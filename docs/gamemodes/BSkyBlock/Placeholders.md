# PlaceHolders

**BSkyBlock** does not have placeholders of its own and integrates into BentoBox addons that implements placeholders, like Level and Likes.

To use these placeholders, you just need to replace `[gamemode]` with `bskyblock` and placeholder will work.

For example: `%bskyblock_world_friendly_name%`

You can find a list of available placeholders here: [BentoBox Placeholders](../../BentoBox/Placeholders/#default-placeholders-for-gamemode-addons).
